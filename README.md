Hi, the program will run best on Python 3 version. Thanks.

#####################

for Number 1 it is a pretty straight forward answer.
there will be a function to load and store
an example of storing data is:
store(a) --> where a is something like {"Key1":"Value1"}
and then you can load it, like
load(a)

######################

for Number 3
you can simulate the program by running the command below:
python program3.py
this will import the necessary class, and run some predefined class.

For Number 2, I am sorry I skip it, it's just don'tÂ have enough time to test it.

Anyway, thank you

Have a great success for your company in the future
